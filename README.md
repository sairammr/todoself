# Project To-Do List Application

## Tagline
"Stay Organized, Stay Productive!"

## Project Overview
The To-Do List Application is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks with a clean and minimal user interface. The application will also support local storage for saving tasks, ensuring that users can access their tasks even after refreshing the page. Additionally, the application will feature a light/dark theme toggle and filtering options for better task management.

## Conclusion
The To-Do List Application aims to provide a simple yet effective way for users to manage their tasks. By breaking down the project into manageable modules and submodules, we can ensure a structured approach to development, making it easier to implement features and maintain the codebase. The optional features of theme toggling and task filtering will enhance user experience and provide additional functionality.
